        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Mofiyinfoluwa.You can simply call me Fiyin!  I am a creative professional with a deep passion for fashion. I have over 3 years of experience, specializing in pattern drafting and garment construction. My approach combines technical expertise with innovative thinking to bring ideas to life. I also enjoy
            crafting impactful content 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have designed outfits for urban professionals, students, and entrepreneurs who appreciate contemporary design, convenience, and affordability.  My line of fashion appeals to both fashion-forward individuals and those looking for timeless basics.My work has always been driven by 
            creativity, curiosity, and a commitment to excellence. With my mindset and approach to work,I have transitioned into tech.  I am in my second semester of the Cloud Engineering program with AltSchool Africa. In my short while with the school,I have developed a passion for innovative solutions thereby designing scalable,reliable and cost effective cloud solutions. Ensuring secure and optimised connections between cloud resources while building and deploying applications without worrying about underlying servers is an interest I recently discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy sketching new designs, exploring new technologies
            and I am always eager to learn something new.
